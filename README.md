# Energy-consumption-Trend-Analysis-with-Power-BI
Energy consumption trend analysis with Power BI involves leveraging the platform's data visualization and analytical capabilities to monitor, understand, and optimize energy usage over time. 
This process begins with importing data from various sources such as smart meters, IoT devices, or building management systems. 
Using Power Query, the data is cleaned and transformed to enable meaningful analysis. 
Visual tools like line charts, bar graphs, heat maps, and KPI gauges are used to track consumption patterns, identify peak usage periods, and compare energy usage across different facilities or time frames. 
With DAX formulas, users can create custom metrics, such as energy consumed per unit of production, to derive deeper insights. 
Power BIâ€™s interactive dashboards allow stakeholders to filter data by time, location, or equipment type, facilitating informed decisions for energy savings and efficiency improvements. 
Additionally, advanced features such as forecasting and anomaly detection help predict future usage and flag irregular consumption behaviors. 
This comprehensive approach supports sustainability goals, cost reduction strategies, and energy efficiency initiatives in industries, commercial buildings, and smart infrastructure projects.
